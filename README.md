4) There will be seven .ini skin files:

There are variants with a solid bar (see above), 5px and 8px as well as dashed bar 5px (see below) and 8px. The Data used bar is graded in colour from green to red. Also included are HD's original and Jayden's modified skin. The ABB.ini skin is the same as the 5px image one and is my current favourite skin.

I also just streamlined the tooltip a bit from the one in the screenshot here.

The graded skins look like this:

The Manage Skin Screen looks like this:

In Rainmeter, select Manage Skins and in the Aussie Broadband folder select abb.ini and load it (see above graphic).
Note you can change transparency in that panel.

On the main skin, clicking the ABB icon will load the customer portal at Aussie.

On first load it will prompt for ABB username and password

In this version, I added a calculation to take into account how much of the current day has been used for days remaining and also days used and am using that to give a more accurate estimate of daily use. I am also now showing the Allowance per day at start of month and remaining with the other information in the tooltip as per the image here.

If you are over your quota for this stage of the month the percent used bar will be red.
